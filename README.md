## Python Course for Code Louisville Summer 2022

###I originally was going to make my project a server dashboard page to connect to my local servers as well as my VPS servers.
###Due to the fact that I got a new job as a Systems Administrator and Application Developer, it took a lot of time away from my work this cohort.
###To make my life easier, I went ahead and switched gears and decided to make a web scraping project because I am already familiar with web scraping with Python before taking this class. I have made a few scrapers already notifying me of a product going below a certain price point on Amazon and sending me an email with the link to the product and the new price.
###To take it a step further, I wanted to scrape data from a website that would have a real world application for me. I have done some projects on the side for clients and one of my clients is a real estate agent and he has requested updated information on listings so that he can use them for his business.
###I wanted to make this project as a start for helping my client and get the experience I need to build him a product that he wants. During my search to scrape the data in the best way possible, I ended up using a Canadian real estate website since they seemed to have a built in API that I could gain access to through Chrome Dev Tools and I could use that to my advantage.
